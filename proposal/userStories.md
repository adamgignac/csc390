============

As a student, I want to:
- input my course schedule into the application
- view my courses in a sidebar
- make reminders for upcoming assignments/tests
- create a new page of notes
- edit an existing page of notes
- link one page of notes to a previous page
- add a web source (reference, Discovery, etc) and reference it from a note
- draw a diagram and insert it into a note
- install the application on an Ubuntu system (and potentially a Windows/Mac system)
- search my notes
