Openness and Communication
--------------------------

- The program will allow a student to get information from a lecturer and store it in such a way that it will be easily accesible and logically structured

Stewardship
-----------
- Extensibility: The program will allow new types of note to be added as plugins, allowing it to support future education scenarios
- Economic: The program will provide a free alternative to commercial software such as Microsoft OneNote

Aesthetic
---------
- The software should be visually appealing and present information clearly and simply

Trust
