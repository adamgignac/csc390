Project Statement
=================

Many students use portable computers to take notes in a modern university
setting. However, there are very few tools specifically designed with this
task in mind; word processors, for example, devote too much attention to 
formatting and layout - important features for printed documents, but hardly 
suited to recording a collection of related ideas such as a lecture. Why 
force users to think in terms of pages and documents, when what they really
want are segments of information?

For my senior project, I will create an application that allows students to
take and organize notes, gather information related to classes, manage their
schedules, and other related functionality. Notes will be automatically
tagged and sorted by date, grouped by course, and can be hyperlinked together.
Text-based notes, web sources, and diagrams will be supported. As an 
additional feature, the appliction should allow for reminders to be added for
upcoming assignments/tests.
